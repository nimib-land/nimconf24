## sep 22 sun

need to work on:

- nimibland vision
- nimib.py
- script/scaletta for live nimib speaking hours

open points:
- should I talk about nblog?
- in general should I have a behind the scenes approach?

what as a first thing?
- nimibook

### nimibook content draft

- what is nimibook
    - a port of mdbook to nim(ib)
        - popular in rust (rsut book) but see also nim days!
    - a (first) static site generator for nimib
- examples of usage:
    - scinim
    - https://getenu.com/docs/intro.html
    - norm
    - nimislides
    - https://can-lehmann.github.io/owlkettle/README
    - why is it not used for nimib documentation? aha!
    - add your own
- how to start
- advanced usage
- behind the scenes: code setup
- history, recent changes and contribs
- open issues, places where you can help (should I triage stuff?)

### speaking hours initial part scaletta

- title slide: we hear voices of Pietro and Hugo but we do not see them
    - they say something like: hey Hugo, we need to talk about updates from NimibLand
- transition to Nimib Speaking Hours where we talk about:
    - how we manage the project, what is our commitment, what are our boundaries
    - what are nimib speaking hours
    - how to contribute
- then: agenda of the talk
- after that we stitch the rest of the videos (with section slides and music?)

ah, we should put this on NimibLand YouTube channel!
