## plan for Sat Oct 12

- watched both videos by Hugo (7' intro to nimib, 10' news from nimislides) [x]
  - made me think: order of stuff and transitions (and target durations) [x]
    - 2' title, agenda (both recording together)
      - transition with Pietro saying: Hugo will now do a very short introduction to Nimib for those who do not know it
    - 7' intro to nimib (hugo)
    - X nimib speaking hours (both)
      - includes intro to nimibland and nimib.py by pietro
      - transitions with Pietro introducing Hugo
    - 10' news from nimislides (hugo)
    - Y intro to nimibook (pietro)
    - 1' thank you and goodbye
    - total: 20' + X + Y
      - try to make X <= 5' and Y <= 10' to have total <= 35'
- finalize slides and record part 1
- script and record part 2 (or maybe I do not even need it?)
- see what can be done about part 3 (or skip). decided to skip already [x]
