## session Fri Sep 20

title: updates from NimibLand

focus:
- content!

nice to haves:
- a template with nimibland logo!

next sync? who knows!

recall: video by 13th!

let's try first to record separately, if we manage we might do a recording together

### idea

record together conversation about NimibLand, like we would do in NimibSpeakingHours (no slides)

### first notes

updates from NimibLand talk (target 20-30 mins), ideas for content
- NimibLand org and purpose (5')
  - minimal intro to nimib 5' (Hugo)
    - show nimib + js/karax
    - reference past videos
  - literate programming and explorables? (Pietro)
- recent releases (nimib, nimislides) 5-10'
  - nimislides (Hugo)
  - a code setup for slides (Pietro?)
- a primer on nimibook (5-10')
- nimib.py? (Pietro) (5')
