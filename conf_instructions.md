Dear NimConf 2024 authors,

thank you for registering your talk for NimConf 2024!
The conference will be held on October 26th 2024.

We want to keep the format we've used previously: all the conference videos should be pre-recorded and uploaded in advance.
We'll be using YouTube as the platform for hosting our videos, and use their 'Premieres' feature for live streaming.
This means that each video will be publicly premiered at a scheduled time, and it will allow watchers to post comments and ask questions as they watch the video: this will allow an interaction between the authors and watchers in real time, and those comments will remain visible for people who will watch the videos at some later time.



Responsibilities and next steps for you as authors:

1. Record your talk.
   At minimum, your video should consist of audio recording of you giving the talk + video recording (720p resolution or higher) of your screen where you show your slides.
   A better version would be a simultaneous video recording of the slides (1080p or higher) with another video (a small one in a corner) of you giving the talk.
   (OBS Studio is an easy-to-use multi-platform free software that can be used for recording your talk. See https://obsproject.com) 

   Because of the way Youtube playlists work (immediately cut off the video that just ended and move to the following one), we ask you to not end your video immediately after your last sentence, but to keep the video rolling for an additional 2 minutes (just showing the last slide in silence). This will allow viewers to ask any additional questions under your video.

2. Send us your video â€” until October 13th.
   After you recorded your video and you're satisfied with it, you need to send it to us or share a link to the video.
   The last day to send it is Sunday October 13th (four weeks from now).
   People usually upload their videos to their google drive or as a private video on Youtube and send us a link to it.

3. Be present when your video is streaming.
   One of the main points of any conference are questions from the audience.
   It is important to have the author present while the video is streaming so you can answer any questions that might arise during the talk.



If you are unable to record your video until Sunday October 13th, please let us know as soon as possible.



Thank you!

The Nim Team
