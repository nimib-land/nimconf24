This is a special episode of Nimib Speaking Hours,
something we started doing right after last NimConf in 2022
H: and in the past 24 months we did 13 of them, including this one
P: ah not so bad for something that targeted being a monthly event! it has become - on average - once every other month!
H: yep! why don't you tell us what was the idea behind Nimib Speaking Hours?
P: well they were inspired by a couple of things:
- on one side we started meeting regularly to prepare last nimconf joint presentation and it seemed a good follow up
- on another side I had seen Simon Willison, a popular open source maintainer in the Python community, offering
speaking hours for his open source project, with the idea of connecting with his users
indeed a problem of open source is that most of the time the interaction with the users is when
they open issues, you rarely hear from happy "customers"
so one of the initial ideas was to connect with users and we tried to actively push this
but I do not think we were very succesfull, right Hugo
H: we also three guests
P: yes but it worked pretty well for keeping a minimal pace of maintenance over the project and align between the two of us
getting to talk was motivation to try and do work
we actually picked up a pretty standard agenda, do you remember what is our usual agenda?
H: yes
- we usually start with a random chat
- then we go over what we did since last time (if we did anything)
- next we review the most recently updated issues on nimibland projects
  and we discuss and work together on the reply to give;
- finally we try to have a vague plan on what we would want to work on next,
with a very lose commitment
P: ah yes the discussion about commitment is very important
there is the agreement between us that we are doing this beacuse we enjoy and we have fun
and the moment it becomes stressful and we have other stressful stuff to deal with this gets
the least priority and we are happy to skip any work we have planned and do another meeting
happily saying we have not done anything!
H: yes, and are you not forgetting something?
P: ah yes, we usually have at least one diversion on something completely unrelated
it is sort of a tradition now, if we do not talk about something unrelated it is not an official speaking hour!
H: so what should we do in this special edition?
P: well, we could be inspired by our own agenda with a broader vision,
for example, this nimconf presentation is a good summary of what we have done in the last two years
H: ah yes, then what do we say about the projects?
P: well we can say a few words about the state of the different project
- nimib development is now focused on finalizing a big change in how
the NbBlocks are implemented
(...discuss more on this)
H: nimislides ...
P: nimibook ...
H: nimibland we need to migrate...
P: ah yes on nimibland I could share a bit on what is the vision that brough us to create the organization
<-- P could share the old slides of nimib for explorables here -->
<-- also it could be a good opportunity to speak about nimib.py in a more informal way -->
P: then there are others like nblog, ssg, p5nim?...
H: ok, so what is the plan for the next future?
P: well one of the things we are trying to do is to make it easier to contribute
H: we could probably try to publicize the next speaking hours so that people can join

<-- before closing insert a diversion at the end -->
